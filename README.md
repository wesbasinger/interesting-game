# Interesting Game

## Background

I wrote this Flask app to use with my Algebra II classroom.  Every year I cover compound interest rates when I do my exponent and logarithm unit and I thought this would be a good application.

## Technical Stuff

I deployed it on Heroku.  You could probably clone the repo, create a heroku app, set one environment variable and push it up.  The only environment variable you should set is MONGO_URI.  I used mLab, the free account, but I'm sure you could spin something up on AWS.

## Feedback

If you have have any feedback, feel free to email me at wbasinger@villagetechschools.org, or open up an issue.  I'd like to see people use this game in their own classrooms.
