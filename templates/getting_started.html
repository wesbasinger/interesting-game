    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h2> Beginning Balance</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      You begin the game with $10,000.  The goal is to accrue as much money as
      possible.  There is no way to add additional cash, you must make your
      fortune from interest and the like.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="well">
    <h2> Different Account Types</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Savings Account</h3>
        <p>This is a very safe option.  There is no risk of losing your
           investment and it does pay an interest rate.  You can liquidate
          this type of account at any time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Mutual Fund</h3>
        <p>
          This account does not pay interest.  Instead, your returns are based
          on the NASDAQ stock index.  You must make a fairly large investment to
          purchase one share, but there is more potential for returns.  The idea
          is to buy low and sell high.  However, there is some risk associated
          with this type of account.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Money Market</h3>
        <p>
          This account pays higher interest than a savings account, but there is
          a slight possibility that the account could crash and you would lose
          your investment.  There is a minimum investment in this type of account.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Government Bond</h3>
        <p>
          This investment pays a nice interest rate, but requires that you leave
          the money in the account for some predecided duration of time.  You cannot
          liquidate the account until the fund matures.  There is also some risk associated
          with this type of account.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Compound Deposit</h3>
        <p>
          This is a lot like a goverment bond, except with a much safer interest rate.
          You must leave the money in the fund until it matures.  There is no chance
          of losing money in this investment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Horse Racing</h3>
        <p>
          To add an element of fun, I have included a group of illicit investments.
          The returns are ridiculously high, but don't expect to get your money back
          a majority of the time!  There's a price to pay for crime :-)
